1. All restricted paths start with /admin/ make sure to implement a simple admin login from frontend and all admin pages sending admin api requests 
should be listed under /admin/ in react router path. 
/admin/* pages should only be accessible if logged in

2. All images are stored in cloudinary , display them through the link received from api response

3. fetch api requests for committee/all in loaders section of react router to avoid latency 

4. All the input fields are in string or file upload, introduce neccessary formatting before sending the api request.
try to use <textarea> wherever possible (especially for description and contact information)

5. Send all fetch request using form data and not as JSON since backend uses form data
